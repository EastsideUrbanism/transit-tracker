You can buy most of these parts directly from Adafruit [using this wishlist](https://www.adafruit.com/wishlists/604463). Just press "Add All to Cart" at the bottom and check out! The only thing not included in the wishlist is the screws.

If you plan on 3D printing your own frame, a printer with at least a 30×115×210mm build volume is required. If you don't have one, you may be able to find one at your local library or university, or get the frame printed from a service online.
