# Build Guide

This guide will walk you through building your own Transit Tracker: an ESP32-S3-based display which shows the real-time arrival times for any public transit route of your choice.

While we will be using this display as a countdown clock, you could customize it with your own firmware and display anything you'd like; however, that's out of scope for this guide.

If you end up building one and want to share, make sure to tag us on Bluesky [@eastsideurbanism.org](https://bsky.app/profile/eastsideurbanism.org) and use #TransitTracker!
