# Build Guide

This guide will walk you through building your own Transit Tracker: an ESP32-S3-based display which shows the real-time arrival times for any public transit route of your choice.

**No prior electronics experience is required!** There's no soldering involved, and the only tools you need are a screwdriver and a 3D printer (or access to one).

If you end up building one and want to share, make sure to tag us on Bluesky [@eastsideurbanism.org](https://bsky.app/profile/eastsideurbanism.org) and use #TransitTracker!
