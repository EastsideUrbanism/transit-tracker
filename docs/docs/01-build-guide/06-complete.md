# You're Done!

You can now mount your Transit Tracker anywhere you please. There are mounting holes on the back of the frame so you can easily mount to the wall with screws. I personally mount mine using 3M Command strips, but you could also place it directly on a desk or other table.

We would love to see your finished product! You can share photos by tagging us on Bluesky [@eastsideurbanism.org](https://bsky.app/profile/eastsideurbanism.org) with the hashtag #TransitTracker.
