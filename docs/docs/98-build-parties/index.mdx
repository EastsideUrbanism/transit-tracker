# Build Parties

As part of our first Transit Tracker parts order, Eastside Urbanism hosted a build party at Redmond Library where everyone could claim their parts and put together their Transit Tracker in a guided process. It was a lot of fun and a great opportunity to learn basic electronics skills while connecting with fellow transit enthusiasts.

## Future Build Parties

We've seen people express a lot of interest in attending a future Transit Tracker build party, so we hope to hold more in the future. As of writing, the uncertainty regarding import tariffs in the United States has made it difficult to plan with confidence since the displays ship from China.

However, if you live in the Seattle metro area and are interested in any updates we have going forward, please [fill out this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSepUjtZ_TYD630fTJdD4KfaF2gi_8MVyM5wXJfIA6wDHEY0-w/viewform) and we'll send you an email as soon as we have more information.

## Community Events

Some community members from outside of the Seattle metro area are organizing Transit Tracker build parties for their region. If you're organizing one (or are interested in doing so), please take a look at our [logistics guide](host-your-own.md). And if you need us to add your local transit agency to the [supported agencies list](../02-user-manual/99-faq/agency-support.md) we can do that too.
