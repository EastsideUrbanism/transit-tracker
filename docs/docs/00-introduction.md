Transit Tracker is a DIY public transit arrivals board powered by an ESP32-S3 and two LED matrix displays. It's entirely open source and can be customized to show arrivals for any route from [any transit agency](./02-user-manual/99-faq/agency-support.md).

It can be useful near wherever there's a bus stop or train station:

- Keep it on your desk or mount it on your wall at home to know when to leave for your bus or train
- Install it in your office to show the next arrivals for a nearby stop
- If you live near a bus stop without schedule information, place it in your window for other riders to see
- Install it in a public space like a library, cafe, or city hall that's near a bus stop

We designed this project to be as accessible as possible with minimal electronics experience required, and all the parts can be purchased for as low as $70 USD. Want to build one? [Let's get started!](./01-build-guide/01-materials.md)
