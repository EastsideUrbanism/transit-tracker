We can easily add support for new transit agencies. Please let us know which you'd like added either in the [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/zhXKQ4vMp8) or by [opening an issue](https://github.com/EastsideUrbanism/transit-tracker/issues).

Since the Transit Tracker API server is open-source, anyone can host their own server and add support for any transit agency they'd like. More information on self-hosting is available in the [API Server](../../03-api-server/index.md) documentation.
