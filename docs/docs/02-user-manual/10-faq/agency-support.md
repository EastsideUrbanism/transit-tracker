# What if my transit agency isn't listed?

We can easily add new transit agencies to the list if they support GTFS (most do). Please let us know which you'd like added either in the [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/zhXKQ4vMp8) or by [opening an issue](https://github.com/EastsideUrbanism/transit-tracker/issues).

You can also host the [Transit Tracker API](https://github.com/tjhorner/transit-tracker-api) yourself, though this is a more advanced option.
