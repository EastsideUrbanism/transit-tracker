## API Server

If you're self-hosting your own [Transit Tracker API server](../../03-advanced/api-server.md), you can enter its URL here. Make sure to include the full URL, including `http://` or `https://`.

## Display Orientation

:::info
Starting in firmware version 2.7.0, the display orientation is automatically detected using the built-in accelerometer, so this option has no effect.
:::

If you want to mount your Transit Tracker so that the USB-C port and buttons are on the left side instead of the right (i.e., if you have a short cable), you can flip the display orientation with this option. Flipping the orientation will also swap the order of the brightness control buttons to match.

## Localization

The Transit Tracker UI will show time units ("Now", "minutes", etc.) in English by default. You can customize these labels if you speak a different language.
