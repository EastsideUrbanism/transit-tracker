# Customize

In this section, you can customize various aspects of your Transit Tracker, such as how routes and headsigns are displayed.

## Abbreviations

Since space on the display is limited, you may wish to shorten the headsign so that it fits better. You can add abbreviations to achieve this.

For example, you can abbreviate "Transit Center" to simply "TC". A headsign of "Bellevue Transit Center" would then read as "Bellevue TC".

## Route Styles

This option lets you change the name and color of each route.
