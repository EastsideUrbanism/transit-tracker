# How do I find my Transit Tracker's IP address?

## USB

1. Connect your Transit Tracker to a computer with a Chromium browser (Firefox and Safari do not support this process).
2. Visit the [configurator](/configurator).
3. Press "Configure".
4. Press "Connect device" at the bottom.
7. Follow the on-screen instructions to connect via USB.
8. Once connected, the configurator will show you the IP address of your Transit Tracker in the top-right corner.

## Router Settings

If you're having trouble finding the Transit Tracker's IP address, you can check your router's settings. Most routers have a page in their web UI which lists all connected devices. Consult your router's manual for more information.
